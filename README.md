# Some Notes
__  To be worked into a setup script at some point __
## Use SSH to clone repo
git clone git@github.com:sebaschi/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles

## Symlink files to correct locations
```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/git/gitconfig ~/.gitconfig
```
```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```
```
ln -s ~/.dotfiles/bash/bashrc ~/.bashrc
```
## Apps/Tools I use
* 'exa' as replacement for 'ls'
* starship.io
* 'neofetch' CLI for system (OS mostly) info
* 'ncdu" CLI disk use info
